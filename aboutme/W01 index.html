<p>I'm hoping to eventually go into cybersecurity. I find hacking to be fascinating, so I think whitehat hacking is a proper calling for me. I have a few uncles who work in web/software design, so I'm excited to be able to talk with them about what I learned in this class.</p>
<p>I spend most of my free time watching movies. Some of my favorites include: Beau is Afraid (2023), Signs (2002), Bo Burnham: Inside (2021), and Snowden (2016).</p>
